A Dreaming Artist

## About Me

I am a self taught amature animator and artist who draws almost everyday. I create many different pieces, including multi-media, pen, pencil and other medias. I strive to become an animator one day for either a large company or to make a profit off my own animations through different social media platforms.

## My Resume

I have not been in a work environment that requires my artistic abilities. Although at my current work position I am a hard working employee who strives to climb up the ladder of employment. I push myself to become a succesful working citizen.

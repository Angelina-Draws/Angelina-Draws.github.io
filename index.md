A Dreaming Artist

## About Me

I am a self taught amature animator and artist who draws almost everyday. I create many different pieces, including multi-media, pen, pencil and other medias. I strive to become an animator one day for either a large company or to make a profit off my own animations through different social media platforms.

## My Resume

I have not been in a work environment that requires my artistic abilities. Although at my current work position I am a hard working employee who strives to climb up the ladder of employment. I push myself to become a succesful working citizen.

The drawing above is a original character I had to model in my advanced anmation class during my senior year of high school. My teacher had given us an assignment to create a character to model. The requirments having been, a two legged creature with distinguishable facial features, that being the mouth, nose and eyes. I modeled my character in the 3D animation program named Maya 2019.



The drawing above is a emotional self reflection on how as a individual there is always the good and the bad side. Essentially two sides of the same coin. Depending on the situation at hand either side could play the leading role. A strong bond with a close family memeber will most likely be on the light or good side. While on the other hand a once trustworthy realtionship is broken would have teh dark or bad side in response.
